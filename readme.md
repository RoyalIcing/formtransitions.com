# Forms + View Transitions

What if you could have dynamic forms without needing complex JavaScript? Instead of worry about client-side vs server-side rendering, hydration, streaming or syncing, instead embrace what the browser can do with built-in forms.

Use `method=get` for things that navigate the current page, such as search pages, product filters,

Use `method=post` for things that modify persisted or session state, such as the database or authentication.
